# SmallGPT
Scope of the Project:

This project aims to implement a minimal, working version of a language model using the decoder-only transformer architecture from scratch. It will cover the core components that power modern large language models (LLMs), including tokenization, positional encoding, multi-head self-attention, feedforward networks, and autoregressive generation. The goal is educational and research-oriented — to help understand the foundational mechanisms behind state-of-the-art AI models beyond the surface-level APIs provided by major tech companies.

Problem Statement:

While there is widespread interest and adoption of AI tools, especially language models like ChatGPT and BERT, most college students and aspiring developers possess only a surface-level understanding of these technologies. Their knowledge is often limited to using APIs rather than understanding the architectures, mathematics, and mechanisms underlying these models. This gap in deep conceptual understanding and the absence of hands-on implementation experience restricts their ability to innovate, contribute to research, or build new systems from first principles.

Reason for Choosing This Problem:

The field of AI is rapidly evolving, and to truly contribute to its advancement, developers must move beyond plug-and-play usage. I chose this project because I have observed that most students and early professionals lack the mindset or resources to explore how deep learning models — especially large language models — actually function. There is an over-reliance on pre-built solutions. Deeper, research-oriented understanding of the architecture and inner workings of such models is essential for nurturing innovation and future contributions in the AI domain.

Proposed Solution / Project Idea:

My project is not aimed at solving a specific task like translation or summarization. Instead, it addresses a meta-problem: the lack of deep understanding in AI development. I propose to build a small-scale, interpretable version of a decoder-only transformer (the foundation for models like GPT) from the ground up. This will include:

Implementing tokenization and vocabulary management
Constructing positional encodings and attention mechanisms manually
Developing the architecture using only basic libraries (like NumPy or PyTorch)
Training the model on a small custom dataset to demonstrate basic language generation
Documenting each part of the process to serve as a learning resource for others
By doing so, I aim to create a project that not only deepens my understanding but also serves as an open-source learning base for others aspiring to enter the field of AI research.
